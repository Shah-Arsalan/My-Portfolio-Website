Dwelling between poverty and hope this movie keeps us invested in the journey of this poor man and eventually to an astonishing end scene. More than anything this movie teaches you how to be Happy and highlights the importance of family in one's life . This is the movie to go to if you need a little inspiration in your life.   </h4>
